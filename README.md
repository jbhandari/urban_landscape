This application is an image gallery that allows users to upload an image to the application. Images are rendered as a thumbnail and then once selected , an image can be seen IN ALL ITS GLORY. 

It uploads on to an Amazon bucket.

###Dev Notes:

In completing this test the following gems were used:
- Image upload
  - carrierwave
  - aws-sdk
  - rmagick
- Authorization
  - Clearance
- Forms
  - SimpleForm
- Development
  - pry-rails
  - binding of caller
  - better errors

In addition for styling I stayed with CSS. From a user experience standpoint I kept colors very basic with thin fonts. For a gallery app I feel lots of whitespace seems like a good fit. The website is quite responsive as well, some tweaks can make it fully responsive.
