#Info-Tech Developer Test

We are looking for the elite, the best of the best, the 5% of developers who are better than the remaining 95%.  We believe that great developers together create great products, and we want to add to our already great place to work.

The purpose of this test is to see how you work with a fairly minimal set of requirements.  We're looking for a final output that has clean, semantic HTML, well commented code, and uses current best practices for MVC development.

##The Task:
Create a simple list of images which allows a user to drill down to the individual images and see the details of each picture.

This should be a Rails application, and the images will be stored on S3.  We will provide you with an S3 bucket and credentials, as well as a github repository.  The rest is up to you.

All thumbnails should be 200x200 pixels.

Each image has:

   * A Picture
   * A Thumbnail
   * A Caption
   * A Description
   * Alternative Text

A user should be able to:

   * See all of the thumbnails on a page.
   * View an individual image.
   * 
      *  See the image’s picture, caption, description, and alt text in the appropriate spots.
   * Upload an image and associated metadata

Language: We’d prefer you use Ruby on Rails, since this is a Rails test.
Frameworks: You are free to use whatever frameworks you would like.
Gems: You are free to use any gems you would like to use.
Javascript Libraries: You are free to use any javascript libraries.

This is your mission.  Good luck.
